# Hmo_Project
A corona managment project for HMO

In this project I implemented a system to manage the Corona database
for a large health fund. The system will display the members at the checkout
the patients, allow their creating and deletion, and manage the records
in a database. Also, the system will store key information about an epidemic
The corona virus in the context of members of the health fund. To this database they will be able to
In the future, apply for the purpose of carrying out various withdrawals.

The system displays a list of all members
in the health fund entered into the system (manual entry), 
For each HMO member, details will be displayed regarding the date of receipt
His corona vaccinations, the date he was sick (if any) and the date
his recovery.
